#### This repository is part of an assignment for a course in Data Analysis (KEN3450) at Maastricht University.

This project aims to investigate different factors affecting individuals' well-being in different boroughs of London. 
In addition to this, different models were also built aiming to predict the level of happiness of someone that wants to
move to the city and is trying to choose the best area to live.
